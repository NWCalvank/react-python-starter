## Installation and Usage

This file describes how to run the project and develop against it.

**NOTE:** The instructions below haven't been tested on Windows. If you are using Windows, it is recommended to use WSL
(Windows Subsytem for Linux).

### Starting a New Project

This repo uses [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). If you will be using this repo as
a starting-point for a new project, it is recommended that you use the following command to setup the repo once you have
cloned it.

This will:
- Install the client submodule
- Remove unnecessary files
- Reinitialize the git history


```
$ make setup
```

**NOTE:** Do not run this command if you would like to contribute to the boilerplate. See the Contributing section for
more details.

### Using a Different Frontend

The submodule pattern allows you to easily swap out the Minimal React repo for a different frontend repo of your choice.
So long as it is written to work with the `docker-compose` file(s) in this repo, your new frontend will work
out-of-the-box with the following steps.

1. Update the `url` in the `.gitmodules` file as shown in the git diff below
   ```
   - url = https://github.com/NWCalvank/minimal-react-boilerplate
   + url = https://github.com/SomeAccount/some-other-frontend
   ```
2. Setup your new app for development
   ```
   $ make setup
   ```

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Docker

### Basic Setup

The project uses Make commands listed in the [Makefile](Makefile) for ease of development.

Please refer to [Makefile](Makefile) for a list of all commands. Some of the most common ones are listed as follows:

`make run` : Launches the application using docker (Builds the images if they haven't been built before)

`make run-server` : Launches the server using docker (Builds the images if they haven't been built before)

`make stop` : Stops any running containers

`make build` : (Re-)Builds container images listed in the docker-compose.

`make clean` : Purges containers, images and volumes.

`make restart` : Stops the app, rebuilds the images and restarts the app.

`make server-test` : Runs the server unit tests.

`make client-test` : Runs the client unit tests.

**NOTE:** If you're having any unexpected issues, it's best to run `make rebuild` to cleanup and rebuild containers from scratch.

## Container Information

- The client container exposes port 3000 and can be viewed by visiting http://localhost:3000
- The server container exposes port 5000 and can be viewed by visiting http://localhost:5000
- The database container exposes port 5432 and can be viewed by using pgAdmin.

## CI/CD

- The application uses Github Workflows to run CI/CD pipelines. For more information checkout the [Github Actions Readme](.github/workflows/README.md)

## Contributing

If you intended to make changes to this boilerplate, you will want to use one of the following workflows.

### Backend/Deployment Changes

If you would like to update any of the Python and/or deployment code, you can treat this repo like any other. Simply
clone the repo, make a branch for your changes, and open a PR for review against the `master` branch.

### Frontend Changes

If you would like to make frontend changes, you should start by making your changes to the
[minimal-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/NWCalvank/minimal-react-boilerplate).  Follow the existing workflow on
that repo while making your updates.

Once your changes have been merged to the `master` branch, you can return to this repo to update the submodule commit
hash to match the one associated with the new latest HEAD on the `minimal-react-boilerplate` `master` branch.

This process has been automated by the following command:
```
$ make update-submodules
```

The new commit hash is now ready to be committed.
